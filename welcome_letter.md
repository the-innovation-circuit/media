# Welcome Letter

For two years now, we've been running an "Innovation Week" at our school. Each Innovation Week brings together students from all walks of life to engage with technology and maker culture. They do so through a carefully crafted curriculum and series of activities that are made to appeal to students.

As we reflect on the past two years we have concluded that we are in a great position to do more. To have a genuine impact, we must go beyond our school and support those who are not as fortunate as us.

We're now in the process of establishing the Innovation Circuit, which in essence is a touring Innovation Week. We'll be taking the fundamentals of Innovation Week and building them into an afternoon event that we can deliver at schools (starting in Singapore & Southern Malaysia). All schools will need to provide is a large indoor space and we'll handle the rest.

If this interests you, we'd love to meet you! Specifically, we're interested in discussing with teachers who'd like to bring the program to their school. Please contact us at contact@innovationcircuit.co.

Looking forward,

Arsh Shrivastava, Edwin Cheah, Diego Paniagua Silva, Sam Poder & Neil Ghosh
